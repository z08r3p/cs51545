CIBC 5003: Environmental Impact
Individual Assessment 3: Sediment Control
Total marks: 25 Weightage: 15%
Note:   This   is   a   summative   assessment.   All   summative   type   assessments   are   compulsory   unless otherwise approved and notes in the course   information
Activity Scenario:Sediments    are    one    of    the    biggest    pollutants    from    construction    sites      and      contribute    to   deteriorating   water   quality   in New   Zealand.   This   assessment   allows   you   to   investigate   the   various   techniques   of sediment   control   that   can   be   used   on   construction   sites   to   minimise   negative impacts on the environment.You have been provided with   a   site   plan   on   which   a   new   building,   car   park   and   improved   amenities (park and sports facility, 3 levels, total 6000 sqm   floor   area) will be constructed   at   the given address: 56 Wairaka Avenue, Mount Albert. (google map link  plan attached   to this assessment)The earthwork is going to start from June 2025 to   October   2025   (winter   and rainy   season).   Before the construction can proceed you have to gain earthworks permission from Auckland   Council. To get permission, you need to submit a detailed   sediment control plan.Check   the   Auckland   Council   sediment   control   guidelines   and   develop   a   detailed   sediment   control   plan   to   ensure   that   the   sediment   is   contained   onsite.   To   develop   and   complete   the   sediment control plan, write a report that includes the following   information.
1.    Consider the water runoff   from the adjacent roads and provide (and explain) a solution to   prevent water entering the site from the road.   (3 marks)
2.    Provide a solution (explain) to stop sediment water entering the cesspit from the road due   to construction vehicle movement. Cesspit locations are marked in the drawing. (3 marks)
3.    Provide    a   solution   (explain)   to   stop   entering   the   sediment   water   into   the   neighbour’s   property.   Please   check   Google   Maps   to   identify   the   local   resident's   houses   beside   the   construction site. (3 marks)
4.    Provide    a    solution    (explain    in    detail)    to   retain   the    sediment   water    on   your    site   and   discharge   the   clean   water   in   the   estuary   and   stormwaterline. (8   marks)
5.    Provide   a   solution   for the vehicles   (such   as   Trucks) that   will   come   on-site   for   work   and   should not take the mud on the road (2 marks)
6.    Mark all the sediment control measures   implemented   on   the   site plan.   (3   marks)
